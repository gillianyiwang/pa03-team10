# pa03-team10

This is our Course finder web application. We had. our team captain Gillian set up the repository, by cloning the cs103aExpressApp and then checkout the pa03 followed by adding the other teamates as collaborators to the repository. We all had to test to see if the app was working properly. We would all clone it locally so that we can then open it up with VScode. We made sure that it allowed us to sign in, view classes, add and delete them from our schedule.

In order to download and install the app, we had to:

Clone our repo to a folder
Be within VScode and open that folder
Call on npm install, npm start, and then start debugging
Call on the localhost:/2000/upsertDB as this will log in the database
After this we reload localhost:/2000
Then we are able to signup for an account
Login with that information, and explore the different searches
Short movie showing all of us using the app and especially features 4 and 5: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j5KeaO1G3H1HibgIzezkcLcsh9iNecU5/view?usp=sharing

We also explain parts of our code here too.
